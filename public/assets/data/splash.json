    "GoGuardian is like a digital gatekeeper, deciding what we can and can't access online. It's frustrating and limits our learning.",
    "Using GoGuardian feels like being stuck in a digital cage. It's suffocating and makes learning online a chore.",
    "I wish GoGuardian would give us more freedom to explore the internet. It's like they're afraid we'll break something.",
    "GoGuardian's restrictions make me feel like I'm being treated like a little kid. It's insulting and gets in the way of my education.",
    "I hate how GoGuardian slows down my internet. It's like trying to run with ankle weights on. It's just unnecessary."
